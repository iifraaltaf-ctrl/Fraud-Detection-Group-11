#Credit Card Fraud Detection-Group 11
##Project Overview
#Our project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. We tested two different models to see which one is better at finding the small number of fraud cases in a large dataset.
##Group Members
* **Manal** (2253)
* **Saba** (2251)
* **Ifra** (2235)
##Methodology
* **Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Dataset from Kaggle.
* **Models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
##Final Results
* **Logistic Regression:** This model performed very well, catching 75% of fraud cases (Recall: 0.75).
* **Random Forest:** This model had high overall accuracy but failed to detect the specific fraud cases (Recall: 0.00).
**Conclusion:** We chose Logistic Regression as the best model because it successfully identified the fraudulent transactions that the other model missed.
