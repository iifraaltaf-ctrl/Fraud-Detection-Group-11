**Credit Card Fraud Detection-Group 11**
 * **Project Overview**
 
Our project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. We tested two different models to see which one is better at finding the small number of fraud cases in a large dataset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * **Group Members**
